title: Welcome to my homepage!
---

I first made this website because I needed a homepage to submit a research paper to journals, but now I use this as a place to store thoughts on particularly useful experiences I've had.

My background is heavily weighted towards research, previously in molecular biology and recently in mathematics. However, now I am working as a trader at SIG. The second largest weight comes from a childhood of gaming, and the rest comes from music, performing arts, things like that. In my free time: I've re-started taking classical piano very seriously, I'm getting into game dev, I started doing yoga. Please reach out if you want to talk about anything!

  I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at Duke University studying for a B.S. in Mathematics. I'm from San Diego, CA. 

  My research interests are predominantly topics in applied mathematics, although I am trying to expose myself to as many different areas of mathematics as possible. I am currently working on a project in **partial differential equations (mixing)** and previously worked on projects in **theoretical machine learning** and **analytic number theory**.

  I have also interned at SIG (Susquehanna) for quant trading.
