I first made this website because I needed a homepage to submit a research paper to journals, but it's become a closet of sorts these days.

My background consists of a lot of academic research, originally in molecular biology and later in mathematics. I'm influenced by a childhood of gaming and concert-pianist-dreams. My newest fixation is woodworking and before that came specialty coffee (which stuck around).

  I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at Duke University studying for a B.S. in Mathematics. I'm from San Diego, CA. 

  My research interests are predominantly topics in applied mathematics, although I am trying to expose myself to as many different areas of mathematics as possible. I am currently working on a project in **partial differential equations (mixing)** and previously worked on projects in **theoretical machine learning** and **analytic number theory**.

  I have also interned at SIG (Susquehanna) for quant trading.
