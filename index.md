I first made this website because I needed a homepage to submit a research paper to journals, but it's become a closet of sorts these days. 

My writing is primarily for myself. I'm influenced by a childhood of gaming and a late-blooming enjoyment of mathematics. I like playing the piano, woodworking, and making coffee for friends. 

I am currently obsessed with motorcycles, having recently purchased one for myself.
