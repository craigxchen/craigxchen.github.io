I am Craig Chen, a recent graduate of Duke University with a B.S. in Mathematics. I'm from San Diego, CA. 

While at Duke, I have worked on research projects in the fields of **partial differential equations (mixing)**, **theoretical machine learning**, and **analytic number theory**. I am now working as a Quantitative Trader at SIG (Susquehanna) in New York.

  I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at Duke University studying for a B.S. in Mathematics. I'm from San Diego, CA. 

  My research interests are predominantly topics in applied mathematics, although I am trying to expose myself to as many different areas of mathematics as possible. I am currently working on a project in **partial differential equations (mixing)** and previously worked on projects in **theoretical machine learning** and **analytic number theory**.

  I have also interned at SIG (Susquehanna) for quant trading.
