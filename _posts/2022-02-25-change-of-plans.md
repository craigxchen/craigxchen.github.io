I've spent the recent few months thinking about what to do after graduation, and although I've finally decided on a course of action, there are still a lot of unresolved thoughts floating around. 




[comment]: # "At its core, I've been trying to answer the question of what makes me happy, which, in its current phrasing, is not well-defined. Firstly, this question may not have a unique answer since there are different types of happiness and the dictionary definition of happiness is not very tractable, so let's define happiness ourselves. I want to define it in a way that allows me to use the term to "classify" my actions, and so, with many implict assumptions we have:"

[comment]: # "<div class="def" text='Simple Happiness'>Something makes me happy if it is a reason for me to continue living.</div>"

[comment]: # "There is a lot to unpack in this definition and it's frankly still not very good, but it's a starting point. Framed this way, it becomes difficult to distinguish short-term gain from long-term gain; the achievement (or the desire to) of a goal in the future is something I believe should be considered a source of happiness, but there may certainly be days where I don't care about the goal, so we need to be more careful in addressing delayed gratification." 

[comment]: # "Reframing happiness this way, it becomes a lot easier to which things I do because they make me happy and which things I do out of some desire to fit in. Combined with some inspiration from other blogs (go check out [Radimentary](https://radimentary.wordpress.com/)), I managed to pin down a few things that I kept me going."


[comment]: # "important assumption which is that of no obligations to others. For example, "because my parents brought me into this world and provided for me" is not a factor in my deciding whether to live or not. Don't get me wrong, though, I am incredibly grateful for my parents' love and I make sure they are aware of that. There's a lot of personal background here which I'll cover in future posts."
