title: welcome to my blog!
---

Like many others, I have wanted to create a blog for a long time, but have only now decided to sit down and figure out how to make one. The main purpose of this blog is simply to be somewhere for me to collect my thoughts, which I have chosen to make public because I imagine that many other people will or have been in similar positions and may find some use from an extra data point. 

The rest of the website will have more "externally relevant" material such as book/cafe/coffee reviews.
