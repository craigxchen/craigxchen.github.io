  I am a 4th-year undergraduate student at Duke University studying for a B.S. in Mathematics.

  My research interests are predominantly topics in applied mathematics, although I am trying to expose myself to as many different areas of mathematics as possible. I am currently working on a project in partial differential equations (mixing) and previously worked on projects in theoretical machine learning and analytic number theory.

  I have also interned at SIG (Susquehanna) as a quant trading intern.
